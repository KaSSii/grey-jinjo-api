# Banjo Kazooie API
Our beloved bear and bird duo don't get much love these days (unless you count Smash) so I decided to make a little public API just to allow other developers to build out a little piece of BK history.

This API will allow you to search for everything in the Banjo universe such as:
* Character Names
* Locations
* Items
* Enemies
* Etc

## What will be (hopefully) covered?
Both main series ORIGINAL games will be covered by this API. 
I may add Nuts & Bolts or the side/spinoff games, _maybe_.  That takes time for one man to do. But I guess this is why it's open source right üòâ?

## Where are you getting your data from?
Currently I am referencing data from the [Fandom Wiki](https://banjokazooie.fandom.com/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie_Wiki). Images I haven't quite decided on how I will obtain due to licensing/copywrite

## Is there a public link for interacting with?
There sure is! Head over to [Grey Jinjo](http://greyjinjo.com) to get started. The website is still in development so check back often!!

## Getting Involved
If you'd like to get involved please go ahead! I'd love for more people to get involved and hopefully make this a great API OR even use this as the basis for your.  

## Support
This is completely free to use (and hopefully forever). But unfortunately server costs are not. Buy me a coffee and for each cup the server stays alive one more month üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
