# Banjo Kazooie API
Our beloved bear and bird duo don't get much love these days (unless you count Smash) so I decided to make a little public API just to allow other developers to build out a little piece of BK history.

This API will allow you to search for everything in the Banjo universe such as:
* Character Names
* Locations
* Items
* Bosses
* Etc

## What will be (hopefully) covered?
Both games main series ORIGINAL games will be covered by this API. 
I may add Nuts & Bolts or the side/spinoff games, maybe. But I guess this is why it's open source right?

## Where are you getting your data from?
Currently I am just referencing data from the [Fandom Wiki](https://banjokazooie.fandom.com/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie_Wiki). Images I haven't quite decided on how I will obtain due to licensing/copywrite

## Is there a public link?
Not quite yet. Once I have a basic version I will add in a public link.

## Support
* Add support link
